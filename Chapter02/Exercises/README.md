## Example Guide
> - [2.6](https://github.com/Hoid17/Java-How-To-Program-10E/tree/master/Chapter02/Exercises/2.06) - Using the statements written in Exercise 2.5, write a complete program that calculates and prints the product of three integers
> - [2.14](https://github.com/Hoid17/Java-How-To-Program-10E/tree/master/Chapter02/Exercises/2.14) - Write an application that displays the numbers 1 to 4 on the same line, with each pair of adjacent numbers separated by one space.  
> - [2.15](https://github.com/Hoid17/Java-How-To-Program-10E/tree/master/Chapter02/Exercises/2.15) - Write an application that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains them from the user and prints their sum, product, difference and quotient (division).  Use the techniques shown in Fig. 2.7
> - [2.16](https://github.com/Hoid17/Java-How-To-Program-10E/tree/master/Chapter02/Exercises/2.16) - Write an application that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains them from the user and displays the larger number followed by the words "is larger". If the numbers are equal, print the message "These numbers are equal".  Use the techniques shown in Fig 2.15
> - [2.17](https://github.com/Hoid17/Java-How-To-Program-10E/tree/master/Chapter02/Exercises/2.17) - Write an application that inputs three integers from the user and displays the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of the numbers.  Use the techniques shown in Fig 2.15
> - [2.18](https://github.com/Hoid17/Java-How-To-Program-10E/tree/master/Chapter02/Exercises/2.18) - Write an application that displays a box, an oval, an arrow and a diamond using asterisks(*)
